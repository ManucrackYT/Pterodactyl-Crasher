This program allows you to simulate situations in which resource redistribution (Runtime Allocation Call) occurs, which can lead to node failure. Designed for use in educational and research purposes, Pterodactyl Crasher helps administrators and developers understand and eliminate potential vulnerabilities and damage to untrusted hosting systems.
